Documentation / www.eelang.org
------------------------------
This web site ([eelang.org](https://www.eelang.org)) is stored directly in the GitHub repository. It is placed in the docs/ folder in the master branch. It is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). All HTML is automatically generated by GitHub on each commit to the docs/ folder.

If you want to work with the web site and preview your changes offline you need to install bundle and run "bundle update" from the docs/ directory. This will install all the needed tools. Then you run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.
